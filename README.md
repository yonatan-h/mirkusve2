Mirkuz + silicon valley == mirkuSVe

This is a project to help a2svians submit thier leetcode answers to github and a2sv google sheet.
1. It should help them time themselves.
2. It should upload their code to their github
3. It should fill the a2sv question sheets (number of submissions, time spent, and file link)

a) currently, the 3rd part is done.
b) the first part is also implemented. no memory is involved (refreshing the webpage resets the timer)
